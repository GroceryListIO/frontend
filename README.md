# Smart Grocery List Frontend

## Getting Started

Modify the `auth.config.ts.` file in the `app/auth` directory and provide your Auth0 client ID and domain.

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run
npm start
```

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
